# Sanchozz's mods for Oxygen Not Included
Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198341359629/myworkshopfiles/?appid=457140

Last tested on game versions: Vanilla and Spaced Out! DLC **509629**

Limited support for so-called beta versions:  
*Public_Testing* - Do not wait for a quick release of fixes if something breaks.  
*Public_Previous_Update* and *Public_Pre_Mergedown* - Previously working mods should theoretically continue to work, but: there are no new mods, no updates, no new features, no fixes.

# Local Downloads
Steam users: Before trying a local download or reporting an issue, use [PeterHan's Mod Updater](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018291283)  to see if the mod is out of date.

Steam sometimes serves outdated mod versions, and Oxygen Not Included is also available on the Epic Games Store. Local copies of these mods are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/SanchozzDeponianin/ONIMods/releases) section, or you can just press `"Code" -> "Download ZIP"`. These mods should be installed into the `Local` folder, creating it if it does not already exist. Mods should remain in their own subfolder.

+ Linux: `~/.config/unity3d/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/mods/Local`
